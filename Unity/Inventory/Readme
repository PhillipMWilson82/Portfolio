This folder contains the prefabs and scripts necessary for a simple inventory and shop.
The aim of this project is to illustrate the following concepts:
  - modular design
  - keeping codebases lightweight
  - uncoupling through events
  - maximizing use of Unity Engine UI and features
  - use of prefabs and flexible/customizable gameobjects


The Inventory UI script will need to be attached to a gameobject (ideally a canvas).
There will also need to be a playerinventory game object with an inventory and InventoryUI script attached.
The comments and documentation should make sense of it.
