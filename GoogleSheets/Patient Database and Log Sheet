This sheet uses elaborate formulas and allowed me to:
- keep a patient database
- keep a daily log of doctor treatments, and a nice display of the ownership splits for each treatment
- track which treatments were paid for on which invoices

The patients were all racehorses whose ever changing ownership was divided amongst people and businesses.  
While we attempted to find a better software solution, this sheet was used to keep track of the doctors daily work, along with the percentages that each owner would have to pay for the work.
